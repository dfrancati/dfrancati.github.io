### About Me ###

Since July 2025, I have been an Assistant Professor (RTT) in the Department of Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.  
Before that, from September 2024 to July 2025, I was an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) in the Department of Information Security at Royal Holloway, University of London.  
From April to August 2024, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at George Mason University, hosted by [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io), and from September 2021 to February 2024, I held a Postdoctoral Researcher position at Aarhus University ([Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup/)), hosted by [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/).  
I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science in September 2021 from Stevens Institute of Technology, where I conducted my research under the supervision of [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io).

### Research Interests ###
My research interests are theoretical and applied cryptography with a focus on advanced public-key primitives and their applications.
I am also interested in watermarking schemes for generative models, privacy-preserving machine learning, and blockchain-based storage systems.
